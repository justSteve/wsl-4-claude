# WSL Environment for Claude Code - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the development of a "best known configuration" WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment optimized for Claude Code and GitHub integration. The project follows a structured approach to ensure reliability, security, and ease of use, especially for developers with limited Linux experience.

## Project Goals

- Create a standardized, well-tested WSL environment for Claude Code
- Automate the setup process with idempotent scripts
- Implement secure credential management across Windows and Linux
- Provide comprehensive documentation and validation
- Follow the "best known configuration" pattern from .NET Framework
- Simplify the Linux learning curve for Windows developers

## Preparation Procedures

### WSL Setup Prerequisites

1. **WSL Installation**
   - Ensure WSL 2 is installed on Windows (required for optimal performance)
   - Verify with PowerShell command: `wsl -l -v` (should show VERSION 2)
   - If WSL 1 is shown, upgrade using: `wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2`
   - If not installed, run in PowerShell (as Administrator): `wsl --install`

2. **Linux Distribution Selection**
   - Ubuntu is the recommended distribution for this environment
   - Initial setup creates a standard user account that will own all files
   - Note your username and password as they'll be needed during setup

3. **Windows-side Preparation**
   - Clone the repository to a Windows location (OneDrive storage works well)
   - Create a directory structure that balances Windows and Linux access
   - Recommended: keep scripts in OneDrive but project files in Linux filesystem

4. **Script Permission Setup**
   - When first accessing scripts, permission errors might occur
   - Run the included `fix-permissions.sh` to make all scripts executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x fix-permissions.sh
     ./fix-permissions.sh
     ```
   - This script handles both root and /scripts directory permissions

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Verify Node.js is installed in WSL (`node -v`)
   - If not installed, follow the installation instructions that appear during setup
   - Create any required API keys before running the credential scripts
   - Note: Windows Defender may require exclusions for WSL directories

### Common Troubleshooting During Preparation

1. **WSL Version Issues**
   - Error: "WSL 1 is not supported" - Even if `wsl -l -v` shows version 2
   - Solution: The updated script handles this false detection automatically

2. **Node.js Path Detection**
   - Error: "Could not determine Node.js install directory"
   - Solution: The updated scripts have improved detection logic and fallbacks
   - Manual override available if automatic detection fails

3. **Line Ending Problems**
   - Symptom: "bad interpreter: No such file or directory"
   - Solution: Fix line endings with `dos2unix` or editors with EOL conversion

4. **Windows/Linux Path Navigation**
   - Windows paths are accessible in WSL via `/mnt/c/...`
   - Linux paths are not directly accessible from Windows
   - The scripts include utilities to handle path conversion

## Components Created

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Main setup script `setup.sh` as the entry point
   - Scripts directory for installation components
   - Configuration templates for environment variables
   - Documentation for usage, credentials, and troubleshooting
   - GitHub workflows for validation

2. **Setup Scripts**
   - `00-init-repo.sh`: Repository initialization
   - `01-wsl-setup.sh`: WSL base configuration
   - `02-dev-tools.sh`: Developer tools installation
   - `03-git-config.sh`: Git and GitHub configuration
   - `04-claude-setup.sh`: Claude Code installation
   - `05-win-credentials.ps1`: Windows credential management
   - `06-lx-credentials.sh`: Linux credential management
   - `99-validation.sh`: Environment validation
   - `fix-permissions.sh`: Utility to make all scripts executable
   - `run-claude-setup.sh`: Dedicated script for Claude Code setup

3. **Security & Credential Management**
   - Windows-side: Uses Windows Credential Manager and PowerShell profiles
   - Linux/WSL-side: Uses encrypted credentials with GPG support
   - Development/Production separation
   - Automatic loading of credentials when starting WSL

4. **Claude Code Integration**
   - Custom configuration for optimal settings
   - Helper scripts for environment switching
   - Project templates for quick starts
   - Pre-defined custom commands

5. **Python Development Support**
   - Virtual environment setup and management
   - Common data science and AI libraries pre-configured
   - Integration with VS Code for Python development
   - Jupyter notebook support

6. **Trading Application Development**
   - Templates for options trading applications
   - Data connectivity components for market data
   - Example scripts for options analysis

## Key Features

- **Progressive Installation**: Scripts build on each other logically
- **Idempotent Design**: Scripts can be run multiple times safely
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Integration between Windows and Linux
- **Security Focus**: Credential management with encryption options
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Built-in script to verify setup
- **Self-Documenting**: Detailed inline documentation and guides
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clear explanations and limited scope for Linux commands

## Implementation Considerations

- **Execution Environment**: Most scripts run in WSL environment, while Windows credential script runs in PowerShell
- **Cross-environment File Access**: Challenges with executing scripts across environments
- **Prerequisites Validation**: Additional scripts to validate or set up WSL prerequisites
- **Windows-Linux Integration**: Ensuring smooth operation between both environments

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Verify WSL 2 is installed and running (`wsl -l -v`)
   - Run the fix-permissions script first: `chmod +x fix-permissions.sh && ./fix-permissions.sh`
   - For a focused Claude Code installation only: `./run-claude-setup.sh`
   - For complete environment setup: `./setup.sh`

2. **Credential Configuration**
   - Run Linux credential script: `./scripts/06-lx-credentials.sh`
   - For Windows credential setup, run in PowerShell: `.\scripts\05-win-credentials.ps1`
   - API keys must be set before using Claude Code and other integrated tools

3. **Validation and Testing**
   - Run the validation script to verify all components: `./scripts/99-validation.sh`
   - Test Claude Code with: `claude --version` or `claudecode`
   - Project templates are available in: `~/projects/claude/template/`

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Access Windows files through `/mnt/c/...` paths
   - Store development files in Linux filesystem for better performance
   - Use VS Code with Remote WSL extension for seamless development

## Current Status and Recent Updates

- Added Python development environment setup with AI/ML libraries
- Improved Windows-side initialization script that now:
  - Checks if WSL is properly installed
  - Sets up a fresh Ubuntu distro if needed
  - Copies scripts to the WSL environment
  - Fixes file system access issues and line ending problems
