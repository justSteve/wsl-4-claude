# Claude WSL Environment - Project Summary

This project provides a comprehensive "best known configuration" for setting up a WSL environment optimized for running Claude Code with GitHub integration. Following a structured approach ensures reliability, security, and ease of use.

## Core Components

### 1. Repository Structure
```
claude-wsl-env/
├── README.md                  # Project overview and quick start
├── setup.sh                   # Main entry point script
├── scripts/                   # Installation and configuration scripts
├── config/                    # Configuration templates and environment files
├── docs/                      # Comprehensive documentation
└── .github/                   # GitHub workflows for validation
```

### 2. Setup Scripts

- **00-init-repo.sh**: Sets up the repository structure, creates gitignore, license, and environment templates
- **01-wsl-setup.sh**: Configures the WSL environment with basic settings, shell improvements, and time synchronization
- **02-dev-tools.sh**: Installs and configures developer tools like Node.js, Python, Git, Docker
- **03-git-config.sh**: Sets up Git configuration, SSH keys, and GitHub integration
- **04-claude-setup.sh**: Installs and configures Claude Code CLI with optimal settings
- **05-win-credentials.ps1**: Manages credentials in Windows environment with PowerShell
- **06-lx-credentials.sh**: Manages credentials in Linux/WSL environment with optional encryption
- **99-validation.sh**: Validates the entire environment setup and creates a report

### 3. Credential Management

The project includes a robust dual-platform credential management system:

- **Windows**: Uses Windows Credential Manager and PowerShell profiles
- **Linux/WSL**: Uses encrypted files (with GPG if available) and shell profiles
- **Environment Separation**: Maintains separate dev and prod environments
- **Automatic Loading**: Credentials load automatically when starting WSL

### 4. Claude Code Integration

The environment is optimized for Claude Code with:

- **Custom Configuration**: Optimized settings in ~/.claude/config.json
- **Helper Scripts**: Wrapper scripts for easy usage and environment switching
- **Project Template**: Ready-to-use template for new Claude Code projects
- **Custom Commands**: Pre-defined custom commands for common tasks

## Key Features

1. **Progressive Installation**: Scripts build on each other in a logical sequence
2. **Idempotent Design**: Scripts can be run multiple times without causing issues
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Integration between Windows and Linux environments
4. **Security First**: Secure credential management with encryption options
5. **Comprehensive Validation**: Built-in validation ensures everything works correctly
6. **Self-Documenting**: Detailed inline documentation and separate guides

## Usage

To set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./setup.sh` to execute the full installation
3. Configure credentials using the credential management scripts
4. Validate the installation with `./scripts/99-validation.sh`

The environment includes helper commands for working with Claude Code:

- `claudecode`: Runs Claude Code with the appropriate environment variables
- `claude-env [dev|prod]`: Switches between development and production environments
- Custom commands accessible from within Claude Code

## Next Steps

This project can be expanded in several ways:

1. Adding more developer tools and language support
2. Creating additional Claude Code custom commands
3. Implementing CI/CD workflows for Claude projects
4. Adding integrations with other AI development tools
5. Creating automated testing for Claude Code projects

The modular design allows for easy extension and customization based on specific requirements.
